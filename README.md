# Typescript Boilerplate

Set up to my personal preferences. Works for both Node and web projects.

What is configured:

- Prettier and ESLint (use Prettier as the text editor formatter)
- Jest for testing (any common Jest test naming convention should work)
- Typescript built through Webpack

Any file in the `src` directory named `*-entry.ts` will be treated as an entry point, and each entry point gets its own HTML file output.
